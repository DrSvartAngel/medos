# MedOS — compact handoff

## UI Foundation 1 — IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE (2026-09-05)

- Branch: ui-foundation-1, based on clean main e22cf4e (also verified on origin). Do not merge automatically.
- Added layout/interaction tokens, Input (multiline), FormField, Section and FeedbackState. Limited adoption: Subject form/editor/detail only. Button and useResponsive now read equal-valued tokens.
- Appearance preserved except explicit input focus border and polite error semantics. Subject queries, validation, count, mutations, deletion and navigation unchanged.
- Schema v6; no dependency/version/store/repository change. No visual redesign, Phase 4.3, broad localization or AI/PDF implementation.
- Static: TypeScript EXIT 0; dependency tree EXIT 0; Phase 2 21 PASS; Phase 3 85 PASS; Phase 4 22 PASS (128 total). Phase 2 literal 44dp assertion updated to verify token wiring/value; relevant rerun passed. Phase 4 adds source-contract coverage, not simulated UI tests.
- Created: theme/layout.ts, theme/interaction.ts; components/ui/Input.tsx, FormField.tsx, Section.tsx, FeedbackState.tsx; docs/UI_FOUNDATION.md.
- Modified: SubjectForm/SubjectEditor/Subject detail; Button; useResponsive; Phase 2/4 validators; four canonical memory docs.
- User-confirmed Phase 4.2 phone PASS, tablet PASS, accumulated tablet regression checks PASS. These do not silently close unspecified older Phase 3 checklist items.
- UI Foundation 1 phone/tablet QA PENDING; no emulator/ADB/device automation performed. User owns physical QA.
- Phase 4.1/4.2 COMPLETE; Master Phase 3 ACTIVE for remaining explicit QA gaps; Master Phase 4 NOT COMPLETE; Phase 4.3 and Phase 5 NOT STARTED. Whole-app localization DEFERRED.
- Future PDF / Gemini Study Engine recorded in ROADMAP only: provider-neutral architecture, Gemini API initially, optional notebook/enterprise integration and other providers later subject to feasibility/approval. No implementation or API availability claim.
- Next: user checks Subject create/edit/detail, validation/error/loading, long text, phone safe area, tablet width and accessible controls; approve next scope separately.

## Phase 4.2 — Subject CRUD — IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

- Phase 4.1 remains COMPLETE. Phase 4.2 Subject create/detail/edit/delete now uses route-local state and existing SQLite repositories; no Subject/Topic Zustand store.
- Committee detail lists Subjects in 50-row pages, created_at ASC / id ASC, with one-row lookahead, retry and focus refresh. No Topic counts on list rows.
- Subject detail shows a real parameterized Topic COUNT, including valid zero and a distinct count error/retry. No Topic CRUD/list UI.
- Shared SubjectForm trims/validates name (required, <=120 UTF-16 units) and optional description (<=2000), allows duplicate names and preserves input on failed saves. Writes precede navigation; parent existence is checked.
- Direct routes load SQLite records, distinguish loading/missing/error, and have safe fallbacks. Deletes return to a valid parent or Committees tab, never the deleted Subject. Subject and Committee warnings explain hierarchy-only cascade and preservation of Focus/Memory/Calendar.
- New files: app/subjects/new.tsx, app/subjects/[id].tsx, app/subjects/edit/[id].tsx; components/curriculum/SubjectForm.tsx, SubjectEditor.tsx, SubjectList.tsx; utils/subjectRoutes.ts.
- Modified: Committee detail; topicRepo count helper; EN/TR catalogs (new Subject strings only); Phase 2/4 validators; four canonical docs.
- Schema remains v6; migrations, dependencies/package versions, Dashboard, domain stores and cross-module linkage unchanged. Whole-app localization remains DEFERRED.
- Static: TypeScript EXIT 0; dependency tree EXIT 0; Phase 2 21 PASS; Phase 3 85 PASS; Phase 4 21 PASS (127 total). Existing data-layer groups retained; UI assertions are source-wiring checks, not runtime/device tests.
- Narrow fixes during validation: new-route address typing; old Committee-delete back assertion updated for safe dismissal; save-order assertion scoped to save handler.
- Physical/manual Phase 4.2 phone/tablet QA PASS, user-confirmed; accumulated tablet regression checks PASS. No emulator/ADB/device automation performed by this agent.
- Master Phase 3 remains ACTIVE for unchanged physical QA debt. Master Phase 4 NOT COMPLETE. Phase 4.3 Topic CRUD and Phase 5 NOT STARTED.
- Phase 4.2 merged to main at e22cf4e. Next action: UI Foundation 1 user QA; await explicit approval before Phase 4.3 or visual redesign.

Manual checklist: create, restart persistence, edit, delete warning/cascade, Topic count, direct routes/back, long names, phone/tablet bottom safe area.

## Working rule

Product first. User performs physical/manual QA; AI runs concise static validation only. No emulator/ADB/device automation. Whole-app localization is deferred. Current branch: ui-foundation-1; do not merge to main.

## Physical QA statuses (PRESERVED — never change these from emulator results)

Verified against canonical/user-confirmed physical statuses; never promote emulator evidence to physical PASS.

| Check | Status |
|---|---|
| Phase 3.2 Android phone QA | PASSED |
| Phase 3.2 Android tablet QA | PASSED |
| Android bottom tab-bar safe-area phone retest | PASSED |
| Android bottom tab-bar safe-area tablet retest | PASSED |
| Phase 3.3 Android phone QA | PASSED |
| Phase 3.3 Android tablet QA | PENDING |
| Phase 3.4 Android phone QA | PENDING |
| Phase 3.4 Android tablet QA | PENDING |
| Phase 3.5 Android phone QA | PENDING |
| Phase 3.5 Android tablet QA | PENDING |
| Phase 3.6 Android phone QA | PENDING |
| Phase 3.6 Android tablet QA | PENDING |
| Consolidated post-Phase-3.6 safe-area regression | PENDING |

Localization phone/tablet QA: DEFERRED with the rest of whole-app localization. Historical emulator evidence is separate and cannot close physical QA.

Phase 1/2 complete; Phase 3.1–3.6 implementation complete; Master Phase 3 **ACTIVE** for remaining explicit QA gaps; Phase 4.1/4.2 **COMPLETE; Phase 4.2 phone/tablet QA PASS**; Phase 5 **NOT STARTED**.
