# MedOS — compact handoff

## Phase 5.1 — Spaced repetition foundation — IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

- Branch phase-5-1-spaced-repetition-foundation from clean main bb443c3. Do not merge automatically.
- Schema v9: one additive flashcards.schedule_state column (unscheduled/learning/reviewing). Reuses interval (whole elapsed 24-hour days) and next_review (Unix ms). ease remains untouched/unused. Existing cards, compatibility values and review history are preserved, not replayed or retroactively scheduled.
- Unscheduled with no history = New; unscheduled with history = Previously reviewed, schedule not set. Both have unknown next review, never an invented historical due date. A real rating initializes scheduling.
- Again: learning state, interval reset to zero, next review exactly 10 minutes after rating. No same-session reinsertion. First non-Again rating, also after Again reset: Hard 1 day, Good 3 days, Easy 7 days.
- Subsequent reviewing intervals: Hard ×1.2, Good ×2, Easy ×3; Math.ceil with minimum previous interval +1 day. Dates always start at the new rating timestamp, including early/free reviews. Invalid rating/timestamp/state/interval or out-of-range date is rejected, never silently repaired.
- All ratings atomically insert history and update schedule in one SQLite transaction. Failure rolls both back, leaves answer visible, and permits retry; duplicate review ID cannot double-write. Existing store advances once after success.
- Separate Review due cards entry on Deck detail. Due (persisted next_review <= now) first by due time/created_at/id, then all unscheduled by created_at/id. Future scheduled cards excluded. Full-deck oldest-first and Lighter Plan max-five remain unchanged; all modes reschedule ratings.
- Due queue is a session snapshot, no automatic reinsertion. Retry/Review again rebuild with the same route mode. Empty due mode says no cards due/unscheduled, not missing cards. DB errors remain explicit.
- Deck panel shows due/new/previously-reviewed-unscheduled counts and next future review; card rows show scheduling state/next date. Refresh on screen focus/foreground/next future boundary, cleaned on blur. Only new EN/TR copy localized.
- Created utils/memoryScheduling.ts, components/memory/MemorySchedulePanel.tsx and scripts/validate-phase5.cjs. Modified migration, memoryRepo, useMemoryStore, Deck detail/review, FlashcardListItem, EN/TR, package script, existing validator current-version/wiring guards and four docs.
- Static: TypeScript EXIT 0, dependency tree EXIT 0; Phase 2 21 PASS, Phase 3 85 PASS, Phase 4 43 PASS, Phase 5 8 PASS (157 total). Phase 3 final rerun passed after two stale source-wiring assertions were adapted; original regression groups retained. In-memory/source checks are not physical QA.
- No new dependencies or lockfile changes. No Topic ↔ Memory linkage (deferred to separately approved Phase 5.2), new store, mastery/retention percentage, weak-topic inference or quotas. Existing session-position bar remains session position only.
- Phase 4.5/4.6/4.7 physical QA DEFERRED, NOT PASS. Phase 5.1 phone/tablet physical QA PENDING, user-owned; no emulator/ADB/device automation.
- Master Phase 4 remains ACTIVE for previously documented deferred scope. Phase 5 ACTIVE, Phase 5.2 NOT STARTED. PDF/Gemini roadmap-only; broad localization DEFERRED.
- Next: user tests new/legacy-unscheduled distinction, all four ratings, persisted dates after restart, Again not reinserted, due/future selection, early full-deck rescheduling, max-five Recovery, empty/error/retry, EN/TR and phone/tablet safe-area/long text.

## Phase 4.7 — Generated exam planning — IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

- Branch phase-4-7-exam-planning from clean main b7b5662; do not merge automatically.
- Committee detail → /committees/exam-plan/[id]. Direct SQLite parent lookup, distinct missing/error/retry states and verified Committee/tab back fallback.
- On-demand plan uses every real Topic under the Committee: Subject created_at/id then Topic created_at/id. A names-only Committee-scoped query avoids paginated-list truncation and does not load objectives/history.
- Study days: today inclusive through day before exam exclusive, all local calendar days including weekends. Equal Topic counts; first days receive the remainder. Every Topic appears exactly once. Equal counts do not imply equal study time, priority or mastery.
- No persisted schedule/checkoff/debt. Rebuild on screen focus, app foreground and local midnight with focus-scoped cleanup, no polling. All Topics remain included even with study evidence. Missing/invalid date, exam today/past and no Topics have truthful states and safe exit.
- UI shows localized exam date, remaining study days, total Topics, Today and subsequent day cards. Shows 14 nonempty day sections initially with more on request; trailing days without assignments are explicitly counted. Phone single column, tablet constrained ScreenWrapper and bottom safe area.
- Topic buttons open existing Topic detail; its existing explicit linked-Focus action is reused. No new direct timer start or Focus redesign, completion signal, Calendar event, reminder, notification or sync.
- Created utils/examPlanRules.ts and app/committees/exam-plan/[id].tsx. Modified Committee detail, topicRepo, EN/TR catalogs, Phase 4 validator and four canonical docs.
- Schema remains v8; no migration, dependencies, new store or persistence. Static: TypeScript EXIT 0, dependency tree EXIT 0, Phase 2 21 PASS, Phase 3 85 PASS, Phase 4 43 PASS (149 total). All passed first run; static assertions are not device/UI QA.
- Phase 4.5/4.6 implementation COMPLETE and physical QA DEFERRED, NOT PASS. Phase 4.6 merged at b7b5662. Phase 4.7 phone/tablet QA DEFERRED, user-owned; no emulator/ADB/device automation.
- Master Phase 4 ACTIVE: original advanced weight/priority and broader progress/weak-topic goals remain deferred/unimplemented and require separate scope decisions; no claim of total Phase 4 closure. No mastery or percentages added.
- Phase 5 NOT STARTED; PDF/Gemini roadmap-only; whole-app localization DEFERRED.
- Next: user tests future/today/past/missing exam, no Topics, balanced ordering/all Topics, open Topic → linked Focus, unchanged plan after study, return/foreground/day rollover, direct back, EN/TR and phone/tablet long-text/safe-area.

## Phase 4.6 — Topic study evidence — IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

- Branch phase-4-6-progress-intelligence from clean main b016d2c. Do not merge automatically.
- Optional Focus → Topic only. Topic detail explicitly starts a standard Focus session using Profile duration and verified Topic → Subject → Committee context. Active sessions can only be continued, never replaced. Existing starts remain unlinked.
- Evidence means at least one linked concluded Focus row with positive integer actual duration and valid ending timestamp: completed/not-cancelled, or cancelled/not-completed with >=30 seconds (existing meaningful-cancel persistence policy). Discarded short cancellations and zero/invalid durations do not count.
- Exact EN/TR state: “Study activity recorded” / “Çalışma kaydı var”; otherwise “No study activity recorded yet” / “Henüz çalışma kaydı yok”. Lookup error is separate, retryable and never represented as no activity. Evidence refreshes on Topic screen focus.
- This is recorded activity only, not learned/unlearned, mastery, completion, weakness or a percentage. Learning objectives are never queried for evidence. No Subject aggregate.
- Schema v8: additive nullable focus_sessions.topic_id FK → topics(id), ON DELETE SET NULL. Legacy rows remain null; no retroactive links, new table/index or dependency. Topic/ancestor deletion preserves Focus history. Save revalidates optional context; deleted context saves unlinked, DB errors preserve the active session for retry.
- Minimal runtime Focus Topic ID/name context clears on teardown and ordinary starts. Pause/resume/break retain it; no Topic store, global curriculum cache or new persistence system.
- Changed: migrations, focusRepo, useFocusStore, Focus screen, Topic detail, EN/TR, Phase 2/3/4 validators, four canonical docs. Memory/Calendar/Dashboard unchanged.
- Static: TypeScript and dependency tree successful; Phase 2 21 PASS, Phase 3 85 PASS, Phase 4 39 PASS (145 total). Updated old SQL-placeholder/current-version assertions; relevant reruns PASS. Source/in-memory checks are not device QA.
- Phase 4.5 implementation COMPLETE and merged at b016d2c; physical QA DEFERRED, NOT PASS. Phase 4.6 phone/tablet physical QA DEFERRED, user-owned; NOT PASS. Older explicit QA statuses unchanged.
- Master Phase 4 ACTIVE. Memory linkage/weak-topic analysis deferred. Weight/priority, Phase 4.7 and Phase 5 NOT STARTED. PDF/Gemini roadmap-only; no visual redesign or broad localization.
- Next: user checks linked start/Committee context, normal unlinked start, finish/evidence/restart, zero and short/meaningful cancel, active protection, Topic deletion during/after Focus, error retry, phone/tablet layout. Await approval after handoff.

## Phase 4.5 — Topic learning objectives — IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

- Branch: phase-4-5-topic-learning-objectives, based on clean main a113842; do not merge to main automatically.
- Only optional Topic learningObjectives text implemented: outer trim, blank/missing becomes '', maximum 2000 UTF-16 units; internal newlines, Unicode, apostrophes and repeated lines preserved. Invalid runtime types are rejected.
- Additive transactional schema v6 → v7: topics.learning_objectives TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ''. Existing rows preserved with empty objectives; failure rolls back without advancing the version. No tables/indexes/FK changes.
- Topic repository maps and parameterizes the field. Parent ownership, creation timestamps, list/count behavior and hierarchy cascades unchanged.
- Topic create/edit reuse the existing save flow and UI Foundation with a secondary multiline field and new EN/TR labels/help/errors. Detail hides the section when empty. No extra route, required step or completion semantics.
- Modified: db/migrations.ts, models/curriculum.ts, utils/curriculumValidation.ts, db/repositories/topicRepo.ts, TopicForm.tsx, TopicEditor.tsx, app/topics/[id].tsx, i18n/en.ts, i18n/tr.ts, Phase 2/3/4 validators and four canonical docs. No new files or dependencies.
- Static: TypeScript EXIT 0; dependency tree EXIT 0; Phase 2 21 PASS; Phase 3 85 PASS; Phase 4 35 PASS (141 total). In-memory DB tests and source assertions are not device/UI tests.
- Phase 4.1 COMPLETE. Phase 4.2/4.3/4.4 and UI Foundation 1 COMPLETE with user-confirmed phone/tablet physical QA PASS. Phase 4.4 merged to main at a113842.
- Phase 4.5 phone/tablet physical QA DEFERRED, user-owned; not PASS. No emulator/ADB/device automation performed. Earlier explicit Phase 3 QA gaps unchanged.
- Master Phase 4 ACTIVE. Weight/priority deferred. Phase 4.6/4.7 and Phase 5 NOT STARTED. No new store, progress/mastery, cross-module linkage or visual redesign.
- Whole-app localization DEFERRED; PDF/Gemini remains roadmap-only.
- Next: user checks Topic empty/populated objectives, restart persistence, edit/clear, multiline/TR/near-max text, conditional detail display and phone keyboard/tablet safe-area layout. Await approval before further work.

## Phase 4.4 — Curriculum integration / closure — IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

- Phase 4.4 merged to main at a113842; implementation branch was phase-4-4-curriculum-closure.
- Committee edit save/back resolves a verified Committee detail or Committees tab; error/missing states have safe exits. Android back listeners are focus-scoped and removed on blur.
- Subject detail/editor now use verified hierarchical dismissal, retaining known Committee context across missing-record/retry states and resetting context on route identity change.
- Committee detail revalidates on focus without polling. Committee edit retains mount-based loading so focus does not reset unsaved form input. Existing Subject/Topic pagination and real Topic COUNT remain unchanged.
- Committee edit/detail stack states use existing bottom-safe-area opt-in and scrolling; touched back labels are localized, minimum targets retained, edit heading can wrap.
- Committee delete title/body/cancel/action consistently use EN/TR. Actual hierarchy-only deletion and external records unchanged.
- Parameter checks reject non-string, blank and control-character inputs without UUID restrictions.
- Modified: Committee detail/edit, Subject detail/editor, subjectRoutes, EN/TR catalogs, Phase 2/4 validators and four canonical docs. No new files, repositories, stores, schema or package changes.
- Static: TypeScript EXIT 0; dependency tree EXIT 0; Phase 2 21 PASS; Phase 3 85 PASS; Phase 4 31 PASS (137 total). Source assertions are not runtime UI tests.
- Phase 4.1 COMPLETE; Phase 4.2/4.3 and UI Foundation 1 COMPLETE with user-confirmed phone/tablet physical QA PASS.
- Phase 4.4 phone/tablet physical QA PASS, user-confirmed. No emulator/ADB/device automation. Existing unspecified Phase 3 gaps remain unchanged.
- Schema v6; Master Phase 4 ACTIVE. Future 4.5 Metadata, 4.6 Progress Intelligence and 4.7 Exam Planning NOT STARTED and require separate approval. Phase 5 NOT STARTED.
- Whole-app localization DEFERRED; PDF/Gemini roadmap-only; no visual redesign or cross-module linkage.
- Next: user checks only changed Committee return/refresh, direct edit/save/back/error/missing, Subject back/parent fallback, delete dialog language, large text and phone/tablet safe area.

## Previous checkpoint (historical)

## Phase 4.3 — Topic CRUD — IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

- Phase 4.3 merged to main at 7819215; implementation branch was phase-4-3-topic-crud.
- Topic create/detail/edit/delete use existing SQLite repositories and route-local state. Topic remains Subject-owned; parent Subject/Committee checked directly and again before saves.
- Subject detail retains its real COUNT and separate count-error handling; TopicList adds 50-row pages with one-row lookahead, first-page focus refresh and retryable failed offset without discarding earlier pages.
- UI Foundation Input/FormField/Section/FeedbackState reused. Name/description use shared trimmed 120/2000 UTF-16 limits; duplicate names allowed. Failed writes preserve drafts; double-submit guarded; navigation follows acknowledged writes.
- Topic is a leaf: delete warning mentions only the Topic. Missing/failed delete stays on-screen; verified Subject → Committee → Committees fallback never returns to a deleted Topic. Explicit and Android hardware back use focus-scoped safe exits.
- Small review fix: editor retains previously verified parent context across retries, clearing it only for a different route identity; fallback destinations are still revalidated.
- Created: app/topics/new.tsx, app/topics/[id].tsx, app/topics/edit/[id].tsx; components/curriculum/TopicForm.tsx, TopicEditor.tsx, TopicList.tsx; utils/topicRoutes.ts.
- Modified: Subject detail; EN/TR catalogs (Topic strings only); Phase 4 validator; four canonical docs. No repository/store/schema/package change.
- Static: TypeScript EXIT 0; dependency tree EXIT 0; Phase 2 21 PASS; Phase 3 85 PASS; Phase 4 27 PASS (133 total). TypeScript/Phase 4 final rerun passed after the retry-context fix. Existing groups preserved; new UI checks are source wiring, not runtime/device tests.
- Phase 4.1/4.2 COMPLETE. Phase 4.2 phone/tablet PASS and UI Foundation 1 phone/tablet PASS are user-confirmed. Accumulated tablet regression PASS remains recorded separately from unspecified older Phase 3 gaps.
- Phase 4.3 physical phone/tablet QA PASS, user-confirmed; no emulator/ADB/device automation by this agent. Schema v6; no dependencies, cross-module Topic linkage or global cache.
- Phase 4.4 NOT STARTED; Master Phase 4 NOT COMPLETE. Master Phase 3 remains ACTIVE for remaining explicit QA gaps. Whole-app localization DEFERRED; PDF/Gemini roadmap-only; no visual redesign.
- Next action: user manual Topic create/restart/detail/edit/delete, duplicate/blank/long-name validation, Topic count refresh, direct/back routes, long text, phone safe area, tablet width and 50+ pagination. Await approval before further scope.

## Previous implementation checkpoints (historical)

## UI Foundation 1 — IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE (2026-09-05)

- UI Foundation 1 merged to main at 89fd5ef; its implementation branch was ui-foundation-1.
- Added layout/interaction tokens, Input (multiline), FormField, Section and FeedbackState. Limited adoption: Subject form/editor/detail only. Button and useResponsive now read equal-valued tokens.
- Appearance preserved except explicit input focus border and polite error semantics. Subject queries, validation, count, mutations, deletion and navigation unchanged.
- Schema v6; no dependency/version/store/repository change. No visual redesign, Phase 4.3, broad localization or AI/PDF implementation.
- Static: TypeScript EXIT 0; dependency tree EXIT 0; Phase 2 21 PASS; Phase 3 85 PASS; Phase 4 22 PASS (128 total). Phase 2 literal 44dp assertion updated to verify token wiring/value; relevant rerun passed. Phase 4 adds source-contract coverage, not simulated UI tests.
- Created: theme/layout.ts, theme/interaction.ts; components/ui/Input.tsx, FormField.tsx, Section.tsx, FeedbackState.tsx; docs/UI_FOUNDATION.md.
- Modified: SubjectForm/SubjectEditor/Subject detail; Button; useResponsive; Phase 2/4 validators; four canonical memory docs.
- User-confirmed Phase 4.2 phone PASS, tablet PASS, accumulated tablet regression checks PASS. These do not silently close unspecified older Phase 3 checklist items.
- UI Foundation 1 phone/tablet physical QA PASS, user-confirmed. No emulator/ADB/device automation performed by this agent.
- Phase 4.1/4.2 COMPLETE; Master Phase 3 ACTIVE for remaining explicit QA gaps; Master Phase 4 NOT COMPLETE; Phase 4.3 and Phase 5 NOT STARTED. Whole-app localization DEFERRED.
- Future PDF / Gemini Study Engine recorded in ROADMAP only: provider-neutral architecture, Gemini API initially, optional notebook/enterprise integration and other providers later subject to feasibility/approval. No implementation or API availability claim.
- Next: user checks Subject create/edit/detail, validation/error/loading, long text, phone safe area, tablet width and accessible controls; approve next scope separately.

## Phase 4.2 — Subject CRUD — IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

- Phase 4.1 remains COMPLETE. Phase 4.2 Subject create/detail/edit/delete now uses route-local state and existing SQLite repositories; no Subject/Topic Zustand store.
- Committee detail lists Subjects in 50-row pages, created_at ASC / id ASC, with one-row lookahead, retry and focus refresh. No Topic counts on list rows.
- Subject detail shows a real parameterized Topic COUNT, including valid zero and a distinct count error/retry. No Topic CRUD/list UI.
- Shared SubjectForm trims/validates name (required, <=120 UTF-16 units) and optional description (<=2000), allows duplicate names and preserves input on failed saves. Writes precede navigation; parent existence is checked.
- Direct routes load SQLite records, distinguish loading/missing/error, and have safe fallbacks. Deletes return to a valid parent or Committees tab, never the deleted Subject. Subject and Committee warnings explain hierarchy-only cascade and preservation of Focus/Memory/Calendar.
- New files: app/subjects/new.tsx, app/subjects/[id].tsx, app/subjects/edit/[id].tsx; components/curriculum/SubjectForm.tsx, SubjectEditor.tsx, SubjectList.tsx; utils/subjectRoutes.ts.
- Modified: Committee detail; topicRepo count helper; EN/TR catalogs (new Subject strings only); Phase 2/4 validators; four canonical docs.
- Schema remains v6; migrations, dependencies/package versions, Dashboard, domain stores and cross-module linkage unchanged. Whole-app localization remains DEFERRED.
- Static: TypeScript EXIT 0; dependency tree EXIT 0; Phase 2 21 PASS; Phase 3 85 PASS; Phase 4 21 PASS (127 total). Existing data-layer groups retained; UI assertions are source-wiring checks, not runtime/device tests.
- Narrow fixes during validation: new-route address typing; old Committee-delete back assertion updated for safe dismissal; save-order assertion scoped to save handler.
- Physical/manual Phase 4.2 phone/tablet QA PASS, user-confirmed; accumulated tablet regression checks PASS. No emulator/ADB/device automation performed by this agent.
- Master Phase 3 remains ACTIVE for unchanged physical QA debt. Master Phase 4 NOT COMPLETE. Phase 4.3 Topic CRUD and Phase 5 NOT STARTED.
- Phase 4.2 merged to main at e22cf4e. Next action: UI Foundation 1 user QA; await explicit approval before Phase 4.3 or visual redesign.

Manual checklist: create, restart persistence, edit, delete warning/cascade, Topic count, direct routes/back, long names, phone/tablet bottom safe area.

## Working rule

Product first. User performs physical/manual QA; AI runs concise static validation only. No emulator/ADB/device automation. Whole-app localization is deferred. Current branch: phase-5-1-spaced-repetition-foundation; do not merge to main.

## Physical QA statuses (PRESERVED — never change these from emulator results)

Verified against canonical/user-confirmed physical statuses; never promote emulator evidence to physical PASS.

| Check | Status |
|---|---|
| Phase 3.2 Android phone QA | PASSED |
| Phase 3.2 Android tablet QA | PASSED |
| Android bottom tab-bar safe-area phone retest | PASSED |
| Android bottom tab-bar safe-area tablet retest | PASSED |
| Phase 3.3 Android phone QA | PASSED |
| Phase 3.3 Android tablet QA | PENDING |
| Phase 3.4 Android phone QA | PENDING |
| Phase 3.4 Android tablet QA | PENDING |
| Phase 3.5 Android phone QA | PENDING |
| Phase 3.5 Android tablet QA | PENDING |
| Phase 3.6 Android phone QA | PENDING |
| Phase 3.6 Android tablet QA | PENDING |
| Consolidated post-Phase-3.6 safe-area regression | PENDING |

Localization phone/tablet QA: DEFERRED with the rest of whole-app localization. Historical emulator evidence is separate and cannot close physical QA.

Phase 1/2 complete; Phase 3.1–3.6 implementation complete; Master Phase 3 **ACTIVE** for remaining explicit QA gaps; Phase 4.1/4.2 **COMPLETE; Phase 4.2 phone/tablet QA PASS**; Phase 5 **NOT STARTED**.
